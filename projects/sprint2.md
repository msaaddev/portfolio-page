## Inspiration

I started out with something different but during the development stage, I shifted towards something else. In most of the games out there, the protagonist is usually a male who is trying to save a woman. But in our game, I reversed the roles. So there is a young lady who is trying to save a knight from an evil sorcerer.

## What it does

In the game, the protagonist has to face different challenges like zombies, monsters to get to the last level and save the knight. There is a complete story behind the game which is as follow:

A long time ago, in a land far away, there was a kingdom that was cursed by an evil sorcerer. The kingdom was called Retro. Before the curse, Retro was one of the happiest places in the world. When the cursed happened, everything changed. People started turning into zombies, monsters.

Seeing how the Retro was slowly becoming a graveyard, the King decided to send the bravest of his knights to capture the evil sorcerer. During the knight's quest, he got tricked by the sorcerer and was led into a trap. The news of the knight's capture spread like the wildfire in the kingdom. Everyone became petrified thinking that there is no hope anymore.

At that grave time, a young lady who claimed that she was from the future stepped forward. She undertook the quest of destroying the evil sorcerer and saving the knight and along with him the entire kingdom.

## How I built it

I used Godot Engine with GDScripts to build this entire game. I made use of the GitHub Project board and implemented every new feature with a different branch. Once the feature is done, I opened a PR that was reviewed by the other team members.

## Challenges I ran into

None of us had previously worked with Godot Engine & GDScripts. And game development was completely new to us. So the most challenging part was probably the entire development process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I have a working prototype in the end.

## What I learned

I learned a lot about Game Development. I learned how I can use the Godot Engine to build 2D games. Also, I learned how to write GDScripts.

## What's next for Retro Mania

I are hoping to add more levels to it. Make them longer. And also increase the difficulty as well.
