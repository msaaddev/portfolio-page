## Inspiration

I all millennials who are also students have this common problem of procrastination that gets us every time. Whenever I are about to do something productive or something related to school, I get easily distracted. Computers & the Internet play a big part in distracting us. So to work on this problem, I decided to build something that helps its users to schedule their school work, to help them add all of their work once, and allow them to focus on what's important.

## What it does

This web app will help you stay focus on your school task. You can add all of your work inside it and when you are done with something, you can just remove it. You can also add work that is assigned to you for next week. It will keep all of it & you can always come back to see what else you need to do.

To be put in simpler words, Notelify will help you do stuff that is ***really*** important.

## How I built it

I built it with React.js & use browser local storage to store the notes data.

## Challenges I ran into

Two of the three members of the team have never worked with React.js. So they learned it as the project progressed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building an MVP.

## What I learned

I learned a couple of things like using React.js, working with Bootstrap, material UI, etc.

## What's next for Notelify

I are going to fix a couple of bugs, add some new features, and probably launch it as a full fledge platform.
